ts prints out a string suitable for a time stamp as YYMMDD-hhmmss.

Output from ts is suitable for embedding in filenames that need to
be tagged with a time stamp. Any such filenames will sort properly because
the date order is echoed as YYYYMMDD.

 -h, --help      show this help and exit
 --only-date     skip printing the time, only print the date
 --short         same as --only-date
 --full-year     print year as YYYY instead of just YY
 --no-seconds    print time as hhmm only
 --no-minutes    print time as hh only
 --only-time     skip printing the date, only print the time
 --round-quarter round minutes down to the nearest 15 
 --round-half    round minutes down to the nearst half hour
 --version       print out the version number and exit
